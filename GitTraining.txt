Hi Vamshi, welcome to git.

Git is a source control system used for managing the source code provided by clients.

Source control system's are two kinds(CENTRALISED & DISTRIBUTED).

Git is a DISTRIBUTED SOURCE CONTROL system, which means it can be managed and accessed from anywhere any time.


Git folder structure:

master
branch
tag


Frequently used Git commands:

git clone ---> Used to download a complete repository files.

git checkout ---> To switch between the branches.

git pull ---> To update the locally downloaded repository files with the server files.

git commit ---> To save the file into server, we should commit the file locally and push them into the server.

git push ---> To upload the locally committed file/files, into the server.

git log ---> To check the last updated details.

git status ---> To verify the current state of the repository.

git gc ---> To clean the repository unversioned files and there references.


Thank you....
